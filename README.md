# Hi, I'm Khan 🌱

**` Humanizer (Developer / Creator)`**

### AboutMe
I'm a full-stack developer who deeply values collaboration and continuous improvement—and I bring a keen eye for small details that can make a big difference.

I don’t just build things for people; I spend time with them, listen to what frustrates them, and work closely with others to explore and shape better solutions together.  
That’s how I find the little gaps, the awkward steps, the parts that don’t quite feel right—and turn them into something smoother.

To me, good development is less about flashy features and more about thoughtful improvements that quietly make life easier.  
I'm driven by curiosity, real-world feedback, and the belief that small changes can have a big impact.

## 🌍 A Developer Who Travels

I’ve had the chance to explore different corners of the world — not just to visit, but to observe how people live, think, and interact with technology.

🇷🇺 🇫🇷 🇮🇹 🇨🇭 🇨🇿 🇭🇺 🇵🇱 🇷🇴 🇦🇺 🇰🇭 🇹🇼

Each place offered a new way of thinking. These experiences continue to shape how I build:  
with empathy, simplicity, and an open mind.

Whether I’m designing a user interface or simplifying a process, I always ask:  
**“Would this feel intuitive to someone from a different background?”**

To me, great development starts with listening — across cultures, across screens.
